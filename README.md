# About

*This project contains some of my most used settings for operating systems, applications and projects. Feel free to use them.*

There are some `.bash_*` files that are used to style my bash and add aliases. Placing them in your home folder should
be sufficient to get them to work.

The `.git*` files set Git aliases and apply a commit message template.

The `.vimrc` currently only sets the default theme to `desert`. This makes blue text more readable when launched from xterm coloured console.

The `ubuntu-installs.md` describes most of the packages that I install on Ubuntu together with the configurations.

## NPM packages to install
